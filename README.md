Team Mostly Harmless code for the Astro Pi Space Lab 2020 competiton.

The purpose of this program was to explore our own experiment idea, whose aim was to investigate the relationship between the intensity of Earth's magnetic field with the status of the ISS (whether it was orbiting on a point over land or over ocean).
It periodically takes pictures from Raspberry Pi IR camera, sorts the coordinates into land or ocean and reads the intensity of the magnetic field from the magnetometer on the Pi's Sense Hat.
